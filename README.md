 ### ðŸ’¡Do I always have to refresh the extension to see my changes?

 Not all components need to be reloaded to see changes made, as shown in the following table:

| Extension component            | Requires extension reload |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| The manifest                   | Yes                      |
| Service worker                | Yes                      |
| Content Scripts               | Yes (plus the host page)  |
| The popup                      | No                       |
| Options page                  | No                       |
